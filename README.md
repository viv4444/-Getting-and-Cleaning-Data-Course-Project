#author----Vivek Singh

##requisites of the project##
#1)A tidy data set
#2)A link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis
#3)A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
#4)Analysis R Script

##objects in this repo##
#analysis R script- run-analysis.R
#goal-contains the r script for achieving the project objectives as stated below
# 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
# 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
# 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
# 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
# 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.



#tidyData.txt- The output of R script containing the required tidy dataset 

#coodebook.md- Containing details of all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.
